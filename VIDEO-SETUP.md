# Video Setup Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the robust video playback solution implemented for the INTERCONNECT homepage hero section.

## Current Status
- **Video File**: `assets/interconnect-top.mp4` (NOT FOUND - needs to be added)
- **Fallback Image**: `assets/hero-fallback.svg` (Created and working)

## Features Implemented

### 1. Error Handling
- Multiple retry attempts (up to 3 times) with exponential backoff
- Graceful fallback to static image when video fails to load
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Automatic pause/play based on viewport visibility
- Network speed detection (shows fallback on slow connections)
- 10-second loading timeout to prevent indefinite waiting

### 3. Browser Compatibility
- Support for all modern browsers
- Fallback message for browsers without video support
- Proper attributes for mobile autoplay (muted, playsinline)

### 4. Video States Handled
- Loading state with opacity transition
- Error states (network, decode, source not found)
- Stalled/slow loading detection
- Autoplay failure handling (common on mobile)

## How to Add the Video

1. Place your video file at: `/home/ooxmichaelxoo/interconnect-clean/assets/interconnect-top.mp4`
2. Recommended video specifications:
   - Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Bitrate: 2-5 Mbps for web
   - Duration: 10-30 seconds (for loop)
   - File size: Under 10MB for fast loading

## Testing

1. Open `test-video.html` in your browser to see real-time status monitoring
2. Check browser console for detailed logs
3. Test on different devices and network speeds
4. Verify fallback image displays when video is unavailable

## Fallback Behavior

When the video fails to load, the system will:
1. Attempt to reload up to 3 times
2. Show the fallback SVG image
3. Log errors to console for debugging
4. Continue to function normally with static image

## Browser Console Messages

- **Success**: "Video autoplay started", "Video loaded completely"
- **Warning**: "Autoplay was prevented" (normal on some mobile devices)
- **Error**: "Video load error", "Video source error", "Video loading timeout"

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. Multiple video formats (WebM, OGG) for better compatibility
2. Poster image attribute for initial frame
3. Custom play/pause controls
4. Loading spinner during video fetch
5. A/B testing between video and static image
